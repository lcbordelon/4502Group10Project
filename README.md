**CSPB 4502 Spring 2024 Data Mining Group Project - Group 10**

### Project Details
- **Title:** DATA MINING INDICATORS OF HEART DISEASE
- **Team Members:**
  - Lindsay Bordelon
  - Cyro Estevao Freire de Lima
  - Eric Hernandez
  
- **Description:** 
<br> This project focuses on utilizing data mining techniques to analyze a heart disease indicator dataset sourced from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The goal is to address several intriguing questions, including identifying states with the highest rates of heart disease, examining the correlation between physical activity and heart disease, and determining the demographic factors associated with the condition. Through advanced machine learning methods, the project aims to develop predictive models to aid in the prevention and management of heart disease.

### Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers

• WHICH STATES HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF HEART DISEASE?
- Arkansas, Florida, Maine, and West Virginia exhibit the highest percentage of their populations affected by Heart Disease, comprising over 7% of each state's population.

• DOES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AFFECT HEART DISEASE?
- Indirectly, yes. In our Bayesian Networks Analysis, we've discerned that while there isn't a direct link between Physical Activity and Heart Disease, there's a significant correlation between Difficulty Walking - attribute associated with Physical Activity - and the presence of Angina, which is strongly correlated with Heart Diseases.

• WHICH FEATURES CORRELATE WITH HEART DISEASE?
- Only HasAngina is directly correlated. Hence, HasAngina is correlated with Age Category and Difficulty Walking.

• IF SOMEONE HAS HEART DISEASE, WHAT IS THE LARGEST & MOST COMMON SET OF
SYMPTOMS/FEATURES?
- The person with Angina (chest pain), difficulty walking and usually age 50 and above.

• WHICH DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE HEART DISEASE?
- Individuals typically affected by heart disease are those who experience angina and are aged 50 years or older, with the likelihood of occurrence increasing with age, difficulty walking and physical activities.

### Application of this Knowledge
- This data mining project seeks to address critical questions regarding Heart Disease, given its profound impact on public health. By understanding the geographical distribution of Heart Disease prevalence, the influence of physical activity, correlated features, prevalent symptoms, and demographic predispositions, targeted interventions and preventive measures can be developed to mitigate its burden and enhance public health outcomes.
